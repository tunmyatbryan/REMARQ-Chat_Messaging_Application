This is a Software Engineering Project in C language. A chat application was designed and developed in which a user can 
send messages as well as react other usersâ€™ messages. Each user can talk to each of the other users one-by-one at the same time. 
The application manages user accounts including creating accounts, adding, and deleting contacts for each user. 
The whole project includes specifying and documenting the software program, designing data structures and algorithms, 
designing software modules, writing original source code, testing and debugging the software program, 
and collaborating and communicating effectively in a team. 
Please refer to Software_Specification.pdf and User_Manual.pdf files inside doc directory for further reference.
